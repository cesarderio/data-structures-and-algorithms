## Approach & Efficiency

We started by creating a function to find the midpoint and setting it to the midpoint variable. We then used a for loop to iterate through the values if they are less than the midpoint, We then used a for loop to iterate through the values if they are greater than the midpoint. We then combine the first array, midpoint and second array into one array.
